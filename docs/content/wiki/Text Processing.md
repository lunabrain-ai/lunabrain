Text normalization is a critical step in natural language processing, and machine learning (ML) techniques have proven to be effective in this domain. ML text normalization techniques involve training models on large corpora of text to learn patterns and rules for standardizing text. These models can then be used to automatically correct spelling errors, expand contractions, and transform abbreviations to their full forms. By using ML text normalization techniques, NLP applications can better understand and process text data, leading to more accurate and efficient analysis.
