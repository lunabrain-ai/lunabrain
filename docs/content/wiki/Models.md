Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly important in various industries as they enable automated predictions, decision-making, and insights from large and complex datasets. These models are designed to improve with time as they receive more data and learn to identify patterns, allowing businesses to make more accurate predictions and informed decisions. One of the prominent platforms for building and deploying state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models is [[Hugging Face]]. Hugging Face provides easy-to-use libraries and tools for building and fine-tuning NLP models and is widely used by developers, data scientists, and researchers to create and train custom NLP models for various use cases, such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation.
